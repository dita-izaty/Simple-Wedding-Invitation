# Simple Wedding Web Invitation

A simple wedding web invitation created with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. This is the first React application I created after learning React and Tailwind CSS last year.
There are still many issues with it, but I chose to share it as an archive and to track my progress in learning and creating website projects with React and Tailwind CSS.
